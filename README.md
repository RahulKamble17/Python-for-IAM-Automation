Manual access provisioning can become much easier and sustainable. Here's a demo of how the query generation phase can be automated to reduce manual errors.

**Note:** This tool was built for a specific team and its functions, mainly including database entry that uses a repetitive SQL query.

**How to use**
1) Run the 'queryGenerator.py' file to open the GUI tool.
2) Enter all details and click on “Add”
3) A query will automatically be produced in an output text file which can be viewed by clicking on “Open File”.
4) The values can be changed as many times as needed and clicking on “Add” will append a new query at the end of the file.
5) clicking on “Clear File” will erase all queries and make the output file ready for its next run.
